You can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation with any number of creatures within 300 feet, this does not take an Action. A contacted creature doesn't need to share a language with you or even understand a language to communicate in this way with it. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can't initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.

A creature with Telepathy can make a Wisdom (Insight) check versus your spell save DC. If it succeeds it becomes aware of your probe. A telepathic creature that fails the Insight check or acreature without telepathy remains unaware of your surface intrusion. As an Action or Bonus Action on subsequent turns, you can attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper the target can make a Wisdom (Insight) check (telepathic creatures make this roll with advantage). If successful, the creature becomes aware of the probe. You gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). On later turns you can use an Action or Bonus Action to probe still deeper, viewing memories, emotions, and thoughts related to a subject you are searching for. You must concentrate on maintaining the probe as if maintaining a spell, if you lose concentration the probe ends, and you must start over if you wish to continue. During its turn, a creature that is aware of the probe can use an Action to attempt a Wisdom saving throw to halt your intrusion. If it succeeds, the creature becomes immune to a deep probe for the duration of this spell. Psycuic LINK As an action or bonus action on your turn, you can form a psychic link that allows you to share the senses and gain a subconscious understanding of a creature you are in telepathic contact with. You can see through the target's eyes and hear what it hears until you end this effect (no action required), gaining the benefits of any special senses that the target has. In addition, the creature has disadvantage on all attacks and ability checks made against you and you have advantage on all attacks and ability checks versus that creature.

You forge a subconscious mental link with all creatures that participate in the ritual, thereafter it can be reestablished on members within range by any member casting the spell using spell slots or by members participating in a ritual.

Members can instantaneously share words, images, sounds, and other sensory messages with one another through the link and can understand any language known by any member of the link. + All linked creatures have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks and disadvantage on Charisma (Deception) checks when dealing with other linked creatures. - All linked creatures are subconsciously aware of the position and condition of all other linked creatures within range allowing a great degree of coordination. The awareness of position and condition is precise enough to teleport to another linked member without a chance of failure. - For the purposes of determining advantage and disadvantage and targeting spells, if any member of the link within range can see or sense an enemy or location all members within range are able to see or sense it.

Linked allies between a linked attacker and an enemy do not provide cover to the enemy. - A linked creature can take the Help Action to help another linked creature as Bonus Action on their turn instead of an Action. - Ifa linked creature suffers Psychic damage, the damage is instead divided evenly among all linked creatures within range (round down).

You create a small three-dimensional image at a point within your reach for as long as you concentrate.

This effect can also generate light equal to a candle. You must concentrate to maintain the image. * Obscure. You subtly obscure the features of a creature or object.

Until you use an action to change this attunement, the item always indicates the direction to that location, creature, or object if it is on the same plane of existence. If not attuned, the item indicates true north. Convenient Staff. (A Staff, Rod, or Wand arcane focus.) As a bonus action you can change the size of the focus from the size of a short wand to the size of a staff. It can be used as an arcane focus in any form. The focus returns to its normal form when the spell ends. Activating this item requires attunement if you are not the caster. Eldritch Illuminator.

You can use an Action to release the focus, causing it to float within 3 feet of you, orbiting your head or moving with you as you direct within your reach. It does not require a hand to wield the floating focus and it is considered to be an object that is being worn while it remains in your space. Using this item requires attunement if you are not the caster. Focus Attunement. (Any Small sized or smaller item.) You imbue an item with a bit of your power allowing it to be used to focus your magic. Until the spell ends you can use that item as an arcane spellcasting focus.

Activating this item requires attunement if you are not the caster. Glamoured Apparel. (A set of armor or clothing.) You imbue an item with a cosmetic illusion. The item can appear to smoke, the eyes of a helm could glow, wisps of light could dance around a hat, etc. The effects are purely cosmetic, however, depending upon the effect it can shed light, up to bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. The effect can be activated or deactivated by the wearer as a bonus action. Image Crystal. (A crystal) You imbue the item with the ability to capture an image. You can use a bonus action to activate the item to capture the image of a 10-foot cube within 30 feet of the crystal. You can then use a bonus action to cause the crystal to display the image at a point within 30 feet at any size up to life size. The crystal can contain a number of images equal to your Intelligence modifier. If an image beyond this number is captured, the first existing image is lost. Impressive Outerwear. (A cape, cloak, or coat.) The wearer of the item can use a bonus action to change the style, color, cut, and apparent material of the garment or cause the garment to waft or billow impressively in a non-existent breeze.

Your hand must be within 60 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll. If you aren't commanding the claw directly, or if the claw moves beyond 60 feet, the claw follows its last command to the best of its ability. Commands given to a crawling claw must be simple. A claw can't be tasked with finding and killing a particular person, because its limited senses and intelligence prevent it from tracking and picking out specific individuals. However, a command to kill all creatures in a particular locale works. A crawling claw can easily feel out the contours of keys and doorknobs, crawling from room to room on a blind killing spree. The spell ends if the claw is destroyed. When this occurs, your hand reforms at the end of your arm when you regain the hit points lost to the spell.
